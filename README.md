Hello, this is the project I've been assigned to work on. I've made some modifications to your QuickDbTest.php file. Specifically, on line 6, I replaced "localhost" with the hostname, and on line 7, I changed the database name to "master" (the default one) instead of "db_vero_digital". I hope you appreciate my efforts to cut down the work and time. :P
